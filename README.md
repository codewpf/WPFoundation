WPFBannerView is support library.

## Requirements
- iOS 10.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

There are two way to use WPFBannerView in your project, or directly drag the WPFBannerView file into your project:

- using CocoaPods
- using Carthage

### Installation with CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. See the [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) section for more details.

#### Podfile
```
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'targetâ€™ do
pod 'WPFoundation'
end
```

### Installation with Carthage (iOS 10+)

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a lightweight dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C. It leverages CocoaTouch modules and is less invasive than CocoaPods.

To install with carthage, follow the instruction on [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

#### Cartfile
```
github "codewpf/WPFoundation"
```

### Import headers in your source files

In the source files where you need to use the library, import the header file:

```swift
import WPFoundation
```
